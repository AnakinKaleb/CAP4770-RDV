The depth isn't determined until the `fit` method finishes. The important point is that parameters are what the model learns on its own from analyzing the training dataset and not something we adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast **hyperparameters** are things we determine and not determined by the algorithm. Hyperparameters are set before the model looks at the training data--in our case before `fit`.  For decision trees there are a number of these hyperparameters. We already saw two: `max_depth` controls the size of the tree and `criterion`. Adjusting one hyperparameter may improve the accuracy of your classifier or it may worsen it. \n",

In a kNN classifier, it may memorize every instance in our training data--*Gabby Douglas who is 49 inches tall and weighs 90 pounds is a gymnast*.  If we test using that same data, the accuracy will tend to be higher than if we tested using data the classifier has never seen before. Again, if we told the algorithm someone who is 49 inches tall and 90 pounds is a gymnast, we shouldn't find it surprising that if we asked it what sport does someone play who is 49 inches and 90 pounds, and the algorithm predicts *gymnast*. We want to see if the algorithm learned or generalized something from processing the dataset. In some previous labs, we reserved 20% of the original data to test on and used 80% for training. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's imagine a process where we will adjust hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of our model. So we build a classifier with one setting of the hyperparameters and build another with a different setting for the hyperparameters and see which one is more accurate. One approach might be:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use 80% of the data to train on.\n",

We kept adjusting the hyperparameters until we improved accuracy and now she is correctly classified as a basketball player. So we tuned our classifier to work well with her and others in the test set. That is what we mean by information from the test set leaking into the classifier.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "Using cross-validation, every instance in our data is used in training and, in a different iteration, in validation. This results in a less biased model. By **bias** we mean that the algorithm is less accurate due to it not taking into account all relevant information in the data. With cross-validation we typically train on a larger percentage of the data than we would if we set aside a fixed validation set. One small disadvantage is that it now take 10 times as long to run.\n",
